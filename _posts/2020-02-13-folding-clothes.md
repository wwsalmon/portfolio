There’s a simple joy to folding clothes. At 2 AM, I descended to my room only to find the pile of unfolded laundry I had left on my bed. I was dismayed at not being able to sleep sooner, but soon enthusiastically tackled the seemingly countless pieces of fabric. One at a time, one by one I take the clothes, roll them, put them down. At first, it doesn’t seem to make an impact. The pile still takes up most of the bed, and I stack things on my pillow. But soon, the somewhat uniform rolls of shirts, socks, and underwear start forming neat patterns. I work in silence at first, then put on music on my phone, quietly. My mind numbs and my hands remember the deftness achieved from having done this task hundreds of times over and over again each week. It’s an incredibly relaxing break from the rest of my day: sitting absolutely still, thoughts of what I need to do and complex ideas I need to synthesize flying around tortuously in my skull. Here there’s no new information, just what I have in front of me, and my hands do their thing, slowly reducing it to order, a steady, comforting progress.
